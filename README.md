# UGAhackathon

## Inspiration

We were inspired by UGA’s DawgCheck system. We thought it was a great logical tool for the greater public to evaluate their COVID worries, and wanted to create a similar program that people outside of UGA could use. We believe the simple interface and step-by-step logic takes some of the emotional stress out of deciding what your next steps should be in regards to COVID-19.

## What it does

It is a program that leads the user through different COVID-19 symptom and exposure scenarios to better inform them of what their next steps should be.

## How we built it

We built it using Java and JavaFX for the user interface.

## Challenges we ran into

Formatting in JavaFX was a challenge, but with some dedication, we figured it out. It was also a challenge to get the project going, as we had to make sure to fully flesh out our idea.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of ourselves for attending our first Hackathon and creating a successful project outside of a classroom environment! We are happy with how our program turned out in a short period.

## What we learned
We learned a lot about the nuances of COVID-19 and the CDC’s effort in combating the pandemic. In a project management sense, we also learned that it is better to talk ideas out and over-communicate to ultimately develop a better project than we could have individually.

## What's next for COVID Symptom Checker

It would be cool to put our program onto a website, so the general public can access and use it.
